Version 1.6.0 (2020-03-18)
==========================

General
-------

* Support of DICOM storage commitment

REST API
--------

* API version has been upgraded to 5
* Added:
  - "/peers/{id}/system": Test the connectivity with a remote peer
    (and also retrieve its version number)
  - "/tools/log-level": Access and/or change the log level without restarting Orthanc
  - "/instances/{id}/frames/{frame}/rendered" and "/instances/{id}/rendered":
    Render frames, taking windowing and resizing into account
  - "/modalities/{...}/storage-commitment": Trigger storage commitment SCU
  - "/storage-commitment/{...}": Access storage commitment reports
  - "/storage-commitment/{...}/remove": Remove instances from storage commitment reports
* Improved:
  - "/changes": Allow the "limit" argument to be greater than 100
  - "/instances": Support "Content-Encoding: gzip" to upload gzip-compressed DICOM files
  - ".../modify" and "/tools/create-dicom": New option "PrivateCreator" for private tags
  - "/modalities/{...}/store": New Boolean argument "StorageCommitment"

Plugins
-------

* New sample plugin: "ConnectivityChecks"

Lua
---

* New events:

  matching on some VRs, ignore main tags below the queried level
