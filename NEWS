Pending changes in the mainline
===========================

General
-------

* New sample plugin: "DelayedDeletion" that will delete files from disk
  asynchronously to speed up deletion of large studies.
* Lua: new "SetHttpTimeout" function
* Lua: new "OnHeartBeat" callback called at regular interval provided that
       you have configured "LuaHeartBeatPeriod" > 0.
* "ExtraMainDicomTags" configuration now accepts Dicom Sequences.  Sequences are
  stored in a dedicated new metadata "MainDicomSequences".  This should improve
  DicomWeb QIDO-RS and avoid warnings like "Accessing Dicom tags from storage when 
  accessing series : 0040,0275".
  Main dicom sequences can now be returned in "MainDicomTags" and in "RequestedTags".

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix the storage cache that was not used by the Plugin SDK.  This fixes the 
  DicomWeb plugin "/rendered" route performance issues.


Maintenance
-----------

* Housekeeper plugin: Fix resume of previous processing
* Added missing MOVEPatientRootQueryRetrieveInformationModel in 
  DicomControlUserConnection::SetupPresentationContexts()
* Improved HttpClient error logging (add method + url)


REST API
--------

* API version upgraded to 18
* /system is now reporting "DatabaseServerIdentifier"
* Added an Asynchronous mode to /modalities/../move.
* "RequestedTags" option can now include DICOM sequences.

Plugins
-------

* New function in the SDK: "OrthancPluginGetDatabaseServerIdentifier"


OrthancFramework (C++)
----------------------

* DicomMap::ParseMainDicomTags has been deprecated -> retrieve "full" tags
  and use DicomMap::FromDicomAsJson instead


Version 1.11.0 (2022-05-09)
===========================

General
-------

* New configuration "ExtraMainDicomTags" to store more tags in the Index DB
  to speed up, e.g, building C-Find, dicom-web or tools/find answers
* New sample plugin: "Housekeeper" that will re-construct the DB/Storage
  when it detects there is room for improvements, e.g:
  - if files were stored with a version of Orthanc prior to 1.9.1,
    the storage might still contain dicom-as-json files that are not needed
    anymore -> it will remove them
  - if "ExtraMainDicomTags" has changed.
  - if "StorageCompression" or "IngestTranscoding" has chagned.
* New configuration "Warnings" to enable/disable individual warnings that can
  be identified by a W0XX prefix in the logs.
  These warnings have been added:
  - W001_TagsBeingReadFromStorage
  - W002_InconsistentDicomTagsInDb
* C-Find and QIDO-RS can now return the InstanceAvailability tag.  Value is 
  always "ONLINE"
* Improved decoding of US Images with Implicit VR.
* Speed-up handling of DicomModalitiesInStudy in C-Find and tools/find queries.

REST API
--------

* API version upgraded to 17
* new options in tools/find:
  - "RequestedTags" (to use together with "Expand": true) contains a list of tags 
    that you'll receive in the "RequestedTags" field in the answers.  These tags
    may be tags from the MainDicomTags in DB, from the DICOM file or 'computed'
    like ModalitiesInStudy.  Check the new configuration "ExtraMainDicomTags" and
    "Warnings" to optimize your queries.
* new query argument "requestedTags" in all API routes listing resources:
  - /patients, /patients/../studies, /patients/../series, /patients/../instances
  - /studies, /studies/../series, /studies/../instances
  - /series, /series/../instances
  - /instances
  ex:
  - /studies/c27857df-4078c84c-1a79ea78-ac357bb2-9dadc119?requestedTags=ModalitiesInStudy
  - /studies?expand&since=0&limit=10&requestedTags=ModalitiesInStudy
  
* /reconstruct routes:
  - new options "ReconstructFiles" (false by default to keep backward compatibility) to 
    potentialy compress/uncompress the files or transcode them if "StorageCompression"
    or "IngestTranscoding" has changed since the file has been ingested.
  POSSIBLE BREAKING-CHANGES:
  - the /reconstruct routes now preserve all metadata
  - the /reconstruct routes now skip the IncomingInstanceFilter
  - the /reconstruct routes won't generate new events like NewStudy, StableStudy, ...
    therefore, the corresponding callbacks won't be called anymore
  - the /reconstruct routes won't affect the patient recycling anymore
* new fields reported in the /system route:
  - "MainDicomTags" to list the tags that are saved in DB
  - "StorageCompression", "OverwriteInstances", "IngestTranscoding" reported from the 
    configuration file
* New option "filename" in "/.../{id}/archive" and "/.../{id}/media" to
  manually set the filename in the "Content-Disposition" HTTP header


Version 1.10.1 (2022-03-23)
===========================

General
-------

* Improved DICOM authorization checks when multiple modalities are
  declared with the same AET.

Plugins
-------

* New function in the SDK: "OrthancPluginRegisterWebDavCollection()"
  to map a WebDAV virtual filesystem into the REST API of Orthanc.

Documentation
-------------

* Removed the "LimitJobs" configuration that is not used anymore since
  the new JobEngine has been introduced (in Orthanc 1.4.0). The
  pending list of jobs is unlimited.


Version 1.10.0 (2022-02-23)
===========================

General
-------

* New configuration "DicomAlwaysAllowFindWorklist" to complement the existing
  "DicomAlwaysAllowFind" configuration.  "DicomAlwaysAllowFind" applies now 
  only to C-Find for Patients/Studies/Series/Instances while C-Find for worklists are
  covered by "DicomAlwaysAllowFindWorklist".  The same changes applies to new 
  configurations in "DicomModalities": "AllowFind" is now complemented by 
  "AllowFindWorklist".
  This new option allows improved security management.  E.g: a modality might have
  only "AllowStore" and "AllowFindWorklist" enabled but might have "AllowFind"
  disabled to prevent listing past patient studies.
  Possible BREAKING-CHANGE: if you relied on "DicomAlwaysAllowFind" or "AllowFind"
  to specifically authorize C-Find for worklist, you now need to explicitly enable
  "DicomAlwaysAllowFindWorklist" and/or "AllowFindWorklist"
* Added a storage cache in RAM to avoid reading the same files multiple times from 
  the storage.  This greatly improves, among other things, the performance of WADO-RS
  retrieval of individual frames of multiframe instances.
* New configuration option "MaximumStorageCacheSize" to configure the size of
  the new storage cache.
* New experimental configuration option "ZipLoaderThreads" to configure the number of 
  threads used to read instances from storage when creating a Zip archive/media.
* Support decoding of black-and-white images (with 1 bit per pixel), notably DICOM SEG
* Added links to download attachments from the Orthanc Explorer
* Fix XSS inside DICOM in Orthanc Explorer (as reported by Stuart Kurutac, NCC Group).  
  XSS Issues were re-introduced in Orthanc 1.9.4.

REST API
--------

* API version upgraded to 16
* If an image can not be decoded, "../preview" and "../rendered" routes
  are now returning "unsupported.png" only if the
  "?returnUnsupportedImage" option is specified; otherwise, it raises
  a 415 HTTP error code.
* Archive jobs response now contains a header Content-Disposition:filename='archive.zip'
* "/instances/{...}/frames/{...}/numpy": Download the frame as a Python numpy array
* "/instances/{...}/numpy": Download the instance as a Python numpy array
* "/series/{...}/numpy": Download the series as a Python numpy array
* Added a "?full" option to "/patients|studies|series|instances/{...}/attachments" route
  to show the mapping alias<->numerical id.
* Added "/patients|studies|series|instances/{...}/attachments/{...}/info" route to retrieve
  the full information about an attachment (size, type, MD5 and UUID)

Lua
---

* New "ReceivedCStoreInstanceFilter" Lua callback to filter instances received
  through C-Store and return a specific C-Store status code.

Plugins
-------

* New functions in the SDK:
  - OrthancPluginRegisterIncomingCStoreInstanceFilter()
  - OrthancPluginRegisterReceivedInstanceCallback()

Maintenance
-----------

* Removed the OpenSSL license exception, as binary versions of Orthanc are now
  designed to use OpenSSL 3.x, that was re-licensed under Apache 2.0, making
  it compatible with the GPL/AGPL licenses used by the Orthanc project:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing
  https://people.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html
* Fix handling of option "DeidentifyLogs", notably for tags (0010,0010) and (0010,0020)
* New configuration options:
  - "DicomThreadsCount" to set the number of threads in the embedded DICOM server
* Fix instances accumulating in DB while their attachments were not stored because of 
  MaximumStorageSize limit reached with a single patient in DB.
* Dropped support for static compilation of OpenSSL 1.0.2
* Upgraded dependencies for static builds (notably on Windows and LSB):
  - openssl 3.0.1
