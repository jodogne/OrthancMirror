=======================
=== Orthanc Roadmap ===
=======================


=======
General
=======

* Configure an user-defined site UID root if generating DICOM UIDs
  ("FromDcmtkBridge::GenerateUuid()")
* Support "/preview" and "/matlab" for LUT color images
* Improve handling of errors in the command queue:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/--njEbqcDDI/rBu8XL-Mm-cJ
* Support partial file retrieval in Orthanc::HttpClient
* Support retry counter in Orthanc::HttpClient
* Option to enable DNS lookups in DICOM: https://goo.gl/woa35Z


============
Dependencies
============

* Switch from libiconv to libICU (http://site.icu-project.org/download),
  as recommended by Boost:
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/locale/doc/html/building_boost_locale.html


=============
Documentation
=============

* Document REST API with Swagger/OpenAPI


========
REST API
========

----------
Short-term
----------

* Create multi-frame images with /tools/create-dicom (by adding a
  "MultiFrame" flag to avoid creating a series)
* In the /studies/{id}/anonymize route, add an option to remove secondary captures.
  They usually contains Patient info in the image.  The SOPClassUID might be used to
  identify such secondary captures.

---------
Long-term
---------

* Stick to the JSONapi or JAREST guidelines for a "v2" of the API:

  http://www.admiraalit.nl/jarest/


=====
DICOM
=====

--------
Mid-term
--------

* Support "Retrieve AE Title" (0008,0054) in C-FIND:
  - On SCP side:
    http://dicom.nema.org/medical/DICOM/2019a/output/chtml/part04/sect_C.4.html#sect_C.4.1.1.3.2
    => As Orthanc is non-distributed, it should simply reply using the AET provided by the caller
  - On SCU side:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/wPl0g5mqZco/5X1Z8tEzBgAJ
* Support "Instance Availability" (0008,0056) in C-FIND:
  http://dicom.nema.org/medical/DICOM/2019a/output/chtml/part04/sect_C.4.html#sect_C.4.1.1.3.2
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/hteDgE6igo8/j-ArqD7pBQAJ
* Support C-GET: 
  http://dclunie.blogspot.be/2016/05/to-c-move-is-human-to-c-get-divine.html
* Check Big Endian transfer syntax in ParsedDicomFile::EmbedImage and
  DicomImageDecoder
* Strict hierarchical C-FIND:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/VBHpeGVSNKM/tkaVvjWFBwAJ

---------
Long-term
---------

* Support DICOM TLS (cf. "--enable-tls" in storescp)
* Support Storage Commitment:
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/orthanc-users/VZOn8St65jw/s8kg_OHesj0J
* Support extended association:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/xD4d3mpc6ms/srF7E2goAAAJ
* Support C-MOVE-CANCEL:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/KnduYBFd06A/o86cl5SeCAAJ

---------
Encodings
---------

* Support multiple specific character sets (cf. "SCSH32" in orthanc-tests)
  - http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.12.html#sect_C.12.1.1.2
  - Japanese test: http://dicom.nema.org/MEDICAL/dicom/2017c/output/chtml/part05/sect_H.3.2.html
* Support Supplementary Kanji set (ISO 2022 IR 159)
* Create DICOM files with multibyte encodings (Korean, JapaneseKanji, SimplifiedChinese)


=======
Plugins
=======

---
SDK
---

* Image transcoding API
* Add plugins for normalized operations (notably so as to support
  Print SCU/SCP):
  https://web.archive.org/web/20170923150432/https://www.medicalconnections.co.uk/kb/DICOM_Print_Service
* Provide access to the Orthanc::DicomUserConnection class in plugins:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/ycDA1xPuTRY/nsT2_GOtEgAJ
* Provide a C++ callback similar to "ReceivedInstanceFilter()" in Lua
  https://book.orthanc-server.com/users/lua.html#filtering-incoming-dicom-instances
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/BtvLTE5Ni8A/vIMhmMgfBAAJ

----------------
Ideas of plugins
----------------

* DICOM-RT primitives (RT-STRUCT, RT-PLAN, RT-DOSE)
* Converter to/from NIfTI
* Decode JPEG2k with grok: https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok
* Generate dynamic HTTP content using Lua:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/KompazkxRSs/5Rh03mzgDAAJ
* More generally, expose more callbacks of the plugin SDK in Lua:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/_FbiRHuXPGM/J-OAv7zaCAAJ
* Authorization plugin for the DICOM protocol:
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/Wv-QEwTE0IA/rvJxoOjcAQAJ
* Configuration interface plugin


===
Lua
===

* Configure HTTP headers from Lua (in HttpGet(), HttpPost(),
  HttpPut(), HttpDelete(), RestApiGet(), RestApiPost(), RestApiPut()
  and RestApiDelete().
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/orthanc-users/WNnW187OILM/6XX_bm96BwAJ


===========
Performance
===========


================
Code refactoring
================

* Use Semaphore::Locker everywhere (instead of explicit
  Release() and Acquire())
* Avoid direct calls to FromDcmtkBridge (make most of its 
  methods private), go through ParsedDicomFile wherever possible

=================
Platform-specific
=================

---------
Packaging
---------

* CentOS and RHEL through EPEL:
  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL_Package_Maintainers

------------------------
Big-endian architectures
------------------------

* Check the generated 16bpp PNG images

-----------------
Microsoft Windows
-----------------

* Add compatibility with non-ASCII paths (Orthanc expresses its paths
  as UTF-8 strings, but Windows expects them to be translated to the 
  system locale)


=====================
External applications
=====================

* Create REST bindings with Slicer
* Create REST bindings with Horos/OsiriX

Misc

-------
Logging
-------

This is a wish expressed in issue #65 on BitBucket:

"Different levels for various modules (nice to have)

We often need to debug DICOM interactions and logs are 'polluted' by
logs from the Rest API, i.e: since I have a process calling the
/changes route every 5 second, I'm lost in 17000 /changes record in my
logs everyday while I just want to check what kind of C-Find requests
are issued by a modality. If we go for it, logs could be configured
via the configuration file: i.e.:

{
  "Web": "info",
  "Dicom": "debug",
  "Db": "warning",
  "WebViewer": "warning", // here WebViewer is a plugin
  "Generic": "warning", // for all stuffs we could not port to the new logging API or old plugins ....
}"
