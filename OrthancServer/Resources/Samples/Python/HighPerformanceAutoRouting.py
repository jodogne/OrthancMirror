TARGET = 'sample'


#
# This sample code shows how to setup a simple, high-performance DICOM
# auto-routing. All the DICOM instances that arrive inside Orthanc
# will be sent to a remote modality. A producer-consumer pattern is
# used. The target modality is specified by the TARGET variable above:
# It must match an entry in the Orthanc configuration file inside the
# "DicomModalities" section.
#
# NOTE: This sample only works with Orthanc >= 0.5.2. Make sure that
# Orthanc was built with "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" to get the best
# performance.
